2. Review Stats: The stats section offers real-time updates on the restaurant's rating, dynamically updating upon form submission. Through an implementation of SVG's, the section displays the average star rating, overall rating, and a breakdown of user ratings, fostering an engaging and interactive experience. Leveraging the power of weighted averaging, our fictitious restaurant benefits from ratings to reflect a fair and accurate representation of user sentiment.

4. Review Form: The review form represents an essential component of our platform, thoughtfully designed as a modal to seamlessly update all preceding sections. The implementation of a modal ensures a graceful transition, utilizing auto scroll and opacity for a polished user experience upon form submission. To further enhance user interaction, we integrated loaders, delivering prompt and accurate feedback for submitted input, while form validation guarantees the completeness of information before submission. Notably, each user's review is prominently displayed as the first entry in the carousel, simultaneously updating the review stats, reinforcing our commitment to ensuring that every user's voice is heard and acknowledged.
